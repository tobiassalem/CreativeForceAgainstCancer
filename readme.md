### CreativeForceAgainstCancer
A machine learning classifier, built with Python and the SciPi libraries
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn


### Dataset Information
What do the instances in this dataset represent?
Each instance corresponds to a patient with a tumour. These all have a set of the measured parameters, 
like the mean radius, mean perimeter, the texture and compactness. 
The diagnosis class indicates 1 for malign, and 0 for benign.


### Workflow
1) Setup environment, check Python library versions etc.
2) Look at the data, check statistics, and visualize it.
3) Perform any pre-processing, like data scaling, cleaning the data from duplicates, etc.
4) Build and evaluate the models (e.g. with K-fold cross validation). 
5) Make predictions.
